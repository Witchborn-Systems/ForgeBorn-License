# ForgeBorn License

*A Witchborn Systems Attribution Oath (Version 1.0.1)*

This repository contains the official text for the ForgeBorn License (v1.0.1), a creator-focused, attribution-based license designed for the modern era of code, AI, and creative work.

## The Spirit

Inspired by the **FlameKeeper’s Vow**: "Build with honor, share with transparency, and always credit your source."

This license allows for free use, remixing, and sharing (even commercially) as long as you provide clear attribution. It's designed to protect creators from unauthorized reselling while encouraging open collaboration.

## How to Use

1. Copy the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file into the root of your project.

2. Add an attribution section to your project's `README.md`.

3. Tag your project `#WitchbornSystems_Oathbound`.

4. Register at [witchbornsystems.org/forgehall](https://witchbornsystems.org/forgehall) to join the community.

## Key Terms (v1.0.1 Summary)

* **Free to Use & Remix:** You can use, modify, and build upon works for any purpose (personal, educational, commercial).

* **Mandatory Attribution:** You must credit the original author(s) visibly when distributing or embedding the work. (Private, personal use is exempt.)

* **SaaS Friendly:** Public-facing services are allowed, as long as credit is clearly visible to users.

* **No Unauthorized Resell:** You cannot white-label or resell the original code, models, or data without explicit permission.
