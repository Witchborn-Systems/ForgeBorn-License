ForgeBorn License

A Witchborn Systems Attribution Oath (Version 1.0)

This repository contains the official text for the ForgeBorn License (v1.0), a creator-focused, attribution-based license designed for the modern era of code, AI, and creative work.

The Spirit

Inspired by the FlameKeeperâ€™s Vow: "Build with honor, share with transparency, and always credit your source."

This license allows for free use, remixing, and sharing (even commercially) as long as you provide clear attribution. It's designed to protect creators from unauthorized reselling while encouraging open collaboration.
