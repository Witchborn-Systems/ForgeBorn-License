# The FlameKeeper’s Vow

This work is not just code, art, or knowledge—it’s memory, blood, and fire forged for all.  
By using, remixing, or sharing it, you honor the Oath:

- Credit your source.
- Keep your work transparent.
- Don’t white-label, erase, or rebrand without a handshake.
- Don’t leech, parasite, or hide—offer a hand up, not a handout.
- If you profit or go commercial, talk to the maker—honor the Hall, join the family.
- If you’re honest and build with respect, you are Oathbound.
- The only true rule: Don’t be a kreftface.

_The Forge remembers._
