Credit original authors visibly (e.g., in docs or UI).

Disclose derivation in public-facing materials.

Avoid white-labeling or reselling without permission.

For SaaS, ensure user-facing credit (e.g., badge or link).

Binary distribution of models is allowed; source code is optional.

Derivative works must adopt ForgeBorn unless the author approves an alternative license.
