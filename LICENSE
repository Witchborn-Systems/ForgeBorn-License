ForgeBorn License
A Witchborn Systems Attribution Oath
Rooted in the FlameKeeper’s Vow

This work is not just code, art, or knowledge—it’s memory, blood, and fire forged for all.
By using, remixing, or sharing it, you honor the Oath:

Credit your source. Keep your work transparent.  
Don’t white-label, erase, or rebrand without a handshake.  
Don’t leech, parasite, or hide—offer a hand up, not a handout.  
If you profit or go commercial, talk to the maker—honor the Hall, join the family.  
If you’re honest and build with respect, you are Oathbound.  
The only true rule: Don’t be a kreftface.

— The Forge remembers. —

=== Main Terms ===

1. Freedom to Use & Share  
Anyone may use, remix, modify, and share this work, free of charge, for any honest purpose—personal, nonprofit, commercial, or educational.

2. Attribution Required  
You must clearly credit the original maker(s) in a way that’s *easy to find* (not buried in legal text).  
Example:  
  “Built with the ForgeBorn License / [Author or Project], a Witchborn Systems Attribution Oath”  
  (link to the repo, homepage, or https://witchbornsystems.org)

3. Transparency  
Credits must be visible in public docs, About pages, or user-facing UIs.  
Don’t hide attribution “in the basement” (cf. Douglas Adams).

4. SaaS & Company Use  
SaaS use is allowed, even for large companies, if credit is public and users can find it.  
Internal/company use: credit must still be clear to all users.

5. No White-Label/Resell Without Permission  
You *cannot* sell, relicense, or rebrand the original source/code/art as your own.  
If you want to white-label, resell, or make it part of a commercial product, **contact the maker for a direct agreement** (may be a donation, partnership, or custom license).

6. Commercial, Enterprise, & Big SaaS  
If you profit at scale, get rich, or build a business on it:  
  - You must keep credit and  
  - It’s strongly expected you support, offer a job, donate, or partner with the author  
  - (But as long as you credit and are transparent, you’re in the clear—unless white-labeling or reselling, which always requires permission)

7. Optional Registration: Forge Hall / Makers Mark  
You can (optionally) register your project at https://witchbornsystems.org/forgehall or tag it as  
  #WitchbornSystems_Oathbound  
Registered projects get public recognition, a digital certificate, and a place in the Hall.

8. Ethics & Liberty  
No use for “evil kreft” (oppression, mass surveillance, hate, abuse)  
When in doubt, honor the dev’s boundaries and mission—liberty and respect are core  
If your use-case is a gray area: **ask first**

9. Violations  
If you violate the license (erase credit, resell, hide origin, abuse the work),  
  - The maker may demand takedown, public correction, and/or pursue legal recourse  
  - Open negotiation is always preferred; talk before conflict

10. Don’t Be a Kreftface  
This license runs on builder’s honor. If you have to ask “is this krefty??”—it probably is.  
Credit, share, and build up, don’t steal, erase, or bury your source.

  - Generated content (images, text, audio, video, code, or art produced by AI)

  - **Transparency:** clearly disclose if your project, product, or output is derived from, trained on, or uses ForgeBorn-licensed assets, data, or models.
  - **No closed-source resell/white-labeling of models, weights, or datasets without explicit permission from the original author(s).**
  - **SaaS and open/public inference endpoints are allowed, provided credit is shown to all upstream sources and contributors.**

- You are encouraged (but never required) to share your models, weights, or data improvements openly, and may register them in the Forge Hall for Oathbound recognition.

- Use of ForgeBorn-licensed models, datasets, or content for oppressive, deceptive, surveillance, or harmful AI systems is forbidden. When in doubt, honor the dev’s boundaries, and ask first.
