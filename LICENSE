ForgeBorn License
A Witchborn Systems Attribution Oath
Version 1.0.1, Released October 31, 2025

This license governs the use, modification, and distribution of code, AI/ML models, datasets, and creative works under the ForgeBorn framework. It is an ethical commitment, not a legally binding contract, relying on community goodwill and transparency. Consult legal counsel for binding applications.

Terms of Use

Freedom to Use and Remix:
You may use, modify, share, and build upon ForgeBorn works freely for any purpose, including personal, educational, or commercial use.

Mandatory Attribution:
Credit the original author(s) visibly in your projectâ€™s primary UI, documentation, or an accessible About page using:

Built with the ForgeBorn License by [author/project], a Witchborn Systems Attribution Oath
https://github.com/Witchborn-Systems/ForgeBorn-License

For APIs or AI outputs, include attribution in response headers or linked documentation.

 * **Scope:** This attribution rule applies **when you modify, publicly distribute, or embed the work** (e.g., in a public-facing application, API, or as part of a new derivative project).
 * **Exception:** Attribution is **not required for general or private personal use** (e.g., running a model on your local machine for your own experimentation or private projects).

SaaS and Public Endpoints:
Hosting on SaaS platforms or public endpoints is permitted, provided credit is clear to all users (e.g., via UI badges or links).

No Unauthorized Resell or White-Label:
You may not white-label, close-source, or resell code, models, weights, or data without explicit written permission from the original author(s).

Author Rights:
Original author(s) retain the right to sell or license their work independently, with no obligation to provide source code.

Binary-Only Distribution:
You may distribute binaries or pre-trained models without source code, at your discretion.

Scaling and Commercial Use:
For projects generating >$100K/year revenue or serving >50,000 users, credit is mandatory, and partnership/support (e.g., donation or collaboration) is strongly encouraged. Contact the maker via witchbornsystems.org/partnerships within 30 days of reaching this threshold.
Commercial projects with >10,000 users must register in the Forge Hall within 60 days.

Ethical Use:
Prohibited uses include state-sponsored surveillance, oppression, or deceptive AI, as determined by community consensus via the Forge Hall.

Attribution and the Forge Hall

Include the standard credit text and tag your work with #WitchbornSystems_Oathbound.
Register your project at witchbornsystems.org/forgehall for public recognition, a digital badge, and a makers mark.
Submission requires a pull request with project details; badges are issued after community review (within 14 days).
Tiered badges: Bronze (basic use), Silver (contributors), Gold (significant enhancements).

AI, Models, and Datasets

You may train, fine-tune, deploy, or remix ForgeBorn-licensed models, weights, or datasets, provided you:

Credit original authors visibly (e.g., in docs or UI).

Disclose derivation in public-facing materials.

Avoid white-labeling or reselling without permission.

For SaaS, ensure user-facing credit (e.g., badge or link).

Binary distribution of models is allowed; source code is optional.

Derivative works must adopt ForgeBorn unless the author approves an alternative license.

License Governance and Versioning

1.  **License Perpetuity:** Witchborn Systems may release new versions or amendments to the ForgeBorn License, but the version of the license that applies to a work is **always the one the work was originally released under.** Your rights to use that work cannot be retroactively changed or revoked.

2.  **Community Governance:** As an open-honor framework, we welcome community input. **Amendments or suggestions for new versions may be proposed via a pull request** on the official ForgeBorn License GitHub repository: `https://github.com/Witchborn-Systems/ForgeBorn-License`.

Disclaimer

This license is provided AS IS. Witchborn Systems and the original author(s) are not liable for any misuse or misinterpretation. For legal binding, adapt this into a formal contract with professional advice.
